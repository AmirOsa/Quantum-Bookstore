Quantum Bookstore is a simple Java-based system designed for managing an online bookstore that supports multiple book types including paper books, eBooks, and demo books. It allows users to add books to inventory, remove outdated ones, and buy available books with appropriate delivery actions. The system is built with extensibility in mind using object-oriented principles, making it easy to introduce new book types or features in the future.
